ROMULUS, Mich. - 
The Federal Aviation Administration says plane heading to Detroit Metropolitan Airport was illuminated by a laser while flying about 3,000 feet off the ground.Agency spokeswoman Elizabeth Isham Cory says in an email that the plane was about 8 miles east of the airport in Romulus on Wednesday when it was struck. No injuries were reported.The FAA says the plane was among more than 20 aircraft reported struck by lasers from the ground on Wednesday over a number of U.S. cities.

Pilot reports laser into cockpit as he prepares to land...





The FAA says there have been 36 reports of lasers being pointed at aircraft in the Detroit area from the start of the year through mid-October, up from 33 in all of 2014. An FBI campaign last year targeted the illegal use of laser pointers to distract airplanes.Pointing a laser at an aircraft is a federal crime, signed into law in 2012."Lasers distract pilots from their safety duties and can lead to temporary blindness during critical phases of flight, such as takeoff and landing. In some cases in the past, pilots have reported eye injuries that required medical treatment," the FAA said.

Ori Rom and Jared Weiner
Eight of the nine people killed in an Akron, Ohio plane crash on Tuesday have been identified, including two Pebb Enterprises principals and five employees.
Boca Raton-based Pebb principals Jared Weiner and Ori Rom, as well as executives Nick Weaver, Gary Shapiro, Thomas Virgin, Diane Smoot and Diana Suriel were killed, according to West Palm Beach station WPTV. Andres Chavez, the pilot, has also been identified as a victim.
Jared Weiner led Pebb’s growth and development activities. Ori Rom was head of asset management of the firm’s existing portfolio. Thomas Virgin was director of construction. Gary Shapiro was director of leasing. Diane Smoot was the company’s director of lease administration and property accounting.
The family-owned company’s website previously listed 15 employees on its contact page.
Crash in Akron, Ohio (Via NBC News)
All nine people on board a Hawker H25, including two crew members, were killed. They were on a trip scouting properties to buy when the small plane crashed into the apartment complex in Akron on Tuesday afternoon. One crew member has not been identified.
The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the accident and has recovered the voice recorder. NBC News is reporting that no distress calls were made before the jet veered of and crashed into the apartments, according to the NTSB.
NTSB Vice Chairman Bella Dinh-Zarr said at a press conference in Akron on Thursday afternoon that the plane was intact upon the moment of impact. A cockpit voice recorder captured sounds of impact, she said. Conversation between the co-pilots and the Cleveland air traffic control center was also discovered in the 30 minute recording. The crew discussed approaching runway 2-5 and weather conditions, including the wind at 8 knots.
Dinh-Zarr said NTSB expects to be on the scene for about two more days, or as long as it takes to discover the cause of the crash.
Pebb, a commercial property management firm active in Palm Beach County, issued the following statement on Tuesday:
“Our hearts are broken this morning with the news of the tragic accident that took the lives of two principals and five employees of Pebb Enterprises. We are shocked and deeply saddened for the families, colleagues and friends of those who perished. Our first priority is to give our fullest support to the family members and loved ones of our co-workers. …”
No one was injured on the ground. The group flew on Monday from Florida to Minnesota, then Iowa to Missouri and then to Cincinnati. On Tuesday, they flew to Dayton before the crash. [WPTV] – Katherine Kallergis

            372019UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said on Monday that the crash of the Russian A321 plane en route from Egypt’s resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh to St. Petersburg could have been caused by a terrorist attack.

            Sputnik/ Rafael DaminovUK Unable to Share All Intelligence on Russian Plane Crash in EgyptThe London authorities provided Moscow with a dossier of intelligence data about the A321 plane crash, but stated that the UK will not be able to reveal all the national intelligence information related to the tradegy.
The UK intelligence said that there was a bomb brought on the plane that caused the crash of the aircraft. The version was announced before the Russian and the Egyptian investigation into the catastrophe was completed.
In response to the question of a Sputnik Radio correspondent on why the UK did not share any of the intelligence data with Russia before making such conclusions, former UK Minister of State for the Armed Forces Doug Henderson said that not all intelligence data can be shared with other countries and that access to particular intelligence information can be restricted.

Nevertheless, he mentioned that there should be a principle allowing maximum sharing of intelligence information among the countries fighting terrorism.
“I think that a principle has to be adopted that there should be maximum sharing of intelligence among those nations in the world who accept a democratic system and who want to counter terrorism,” Henderson said.
On October 31, the biggest tragedy in the history of Russian civil aviation occurred when the Airbus A321 operated by Russia's Kogalymavia with 224 people on board crashed in the Sinai Peninsula en route from Egypt’s resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh to St. Petersburg, killing all people on board.
“I think that when any of the nations who should work together on that have access to that information then it should be shared as widely as possible. Clearly you cannot share it so widely that it might perhaps leak to those who are about to commit crimes of terrorism,” the former minister added.
According to Henderson, Egypt is among those countries with a high risk of terrorism. In some areas, the country has weak forms of security which have to be strengthened, the politician claimed.
“There is a need for a much clearer and more effective system of security in airports in some of the areas, and for instance in Sinai,” Henderson said.

                ©
            Sputnik/ Maxim GrigoryevKremlin Says UK Not Sharing Intelligence on Russian A321 Crash in EgyptEarlier a whole array of security gaps at the airport of the Egyptian resort Sharm el-Sheikh was reportedly revealed by the airport’s security officials.
Henderson argued that if the crash was an accident, everything possible will be done to try to prevent such accidents from taking place in the future. But if it was an act of terrorism, it would be much more difficult because the forms of terrorism tend to change, making it hard for intelligence services to prevent the imminent attacks.

        ‘Je ne suis PAS Charlie’: Russians respond to Hebdo plane crash caricatures with own drawings

        #IamnotCharlie, Russians say, posting dozens of caricatures and drawings online, in outrage over French magazine Charlie Hebdo’s caricatures ridiculing the fatal plane crash in the Sinai Desert. 

    Two hundred and twenty-four lives were lost in the tragedy, but the satirical mag thought it a fit occasion for a joke.Российские художники ответили на карикатуры Charlie Hebdo

Not in your case!]The Russian hashtag translated as #IamnotCharlie has been trending on all social networks for several days in Russia, with many – from the public to political parties – expressing their rage and bewilderment over how a fatal tragedy, the worst national air disaster, could turn into a laughing matter.Charlie Hedbo didn’t seem to satisfy its readers with just a couple of caricatures: a couple of days ago, they published yet another drawing that pictures the A321 plane and a rocket slamming into the aircraft’s rear part, which looks like an anus.The drawing equates the crash with sexual intercourse in the caption that reads, “Finally, the sex tape!” with the rocket hinting at a possible terror attack being behind the crash.Новый офис Шарли

The caption reads, “The source of inspiration for Charlie Hebdo.”Just over a week ago, following the publication of the first two first caricatures making fun of the plane crash, angry people asked why the staff at Charlie Hebdo hadn’t printed a cartoon of their team who were shot dead by jihadists in Paris in January.Twitter users added sarcastically, “That would have been really funny for them.”Others called not to react to the drawings, as the authors are trying to “provoke a reaction.”Charlie выпрашивает новую кару: российские художники отвечают французам

AKRON, Ohio-- The National Transportation Safety Board provided new information into its investigation of a deadly plane crash during a news conference Thursday afternoon.
A small jet crashed into an apartment building at Mogadore and Skelton roads just before 3 p.m. on Tuesday, killing everyone on board. The plane was carrying a pilot, co-pilot and seven employees of the Florida-based PEBB Enterprises.
No one on the ground was injured. One apartment building was destroyed and it damaged two others, displacing several families.

NTSB Vice Chairman Bell Dihn-Zarr said investigators removed both engines of the Hawker 125-700, and they are still searching the apartment and nearby properties for more parts. The plane was manufactured in 1979.
"The airplane structure was predominantly consumed by the fire and impact forces," Dihn-Zarr said. "All four corners of the airplane, the wings, the tail and nose are present."
The cockpit voice recorder was recovered on Wednesday and shipped to Washington D.C. for analysis. Dihn-Zarr said fire damaged the outside of the recorder and the tape contains 30 minutes of poor-quality audio.
The crew discussed weather conditions and the sound of impact was recorded.
The NTSB is reviewing maintenance records for the jet, as well as records and certifications for the crew. The pilot has more than 6,000 hours of flight time while the co-pilot had more than 4,500 hours, Dihn-Zarr said.
Keep checking with FOX 8 News and fox8.com for continuing coverage of the Akron plane crash.

Egypt: Downed Russian Plane's Final Seconds Will Be Analyzed Abroad
The recording will be analyzed with a technology "unavailable in most countries."



Posted: 11/13/2015 09:19 AM EST


   Russian Ministry for Emergency Situations/Associated Press Egypt says the final seven seconds of the cockpit voice recording from Russian Metrojet Flight 9268, which crashed on Oct. 31, will be analyzed in a different country.     







CAIRO (AP) — Egypt's civil aviation minister says the final seven seconds of the cockpit voice recording from the Russian plane that crashed on Oct. 31 in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula will be sent to a country that has the capabilities to analyze it.


Hossam Kamal tells state-run newspaper Al-Ahram in an interview published Friday that a copy of the recording needs to be analyzed with technology "unavailable in most countries." The investigation team has said the recordings include a last-second noise.


Kamal says the original tape will not be transported out of Egypt, which is leading the investigation alongside representatives from Russia, France, Germany, and Ireland. He didn't identify the country.


All 224 people on the plane, most of them Russian tourists, were killed.

Story HighlightsNick Weaver had been on the job for only eight days when he died with six colleagues in a plane crash Tuesday in Akron, Ohio.Weaver, 36, who was married to Robin Gargano Weaver, was part of a group from Boca Raton-based PEBB Enterprises that was on a six-city tour scouting real estate. Akron was their last stop on the two-day trip, a family spokeswoman told The Palm Beach Post, and they were expected home Tuesday, the day of the crash.Nick Weaver with wife Robin Gargano Weaver. (Family photo)National Transportation Safety Board officials are investigating what caused the 10-seat Hawker Siddeley 125 jet to hit a four-unit apartment building. The crash killed two principals and five employees of PEBB, and two crew members.Weaver was the second victim whose identity had been released. PEBB executive Diane Smoot, 50, of Delray Beach also died in the crash, family members confirmed in media reports.Authorities have not publicly identified all of those on board.Before working at PEBB, Weaver of Boca Raton worked for six years at Ragland & Associates, also based in Boca. He was vice president of real estate and development, and became an expert in the Midwest real estate market, his family said in a statement.“His expertise in that region made him the perfect fit for PEBB, as they continue to expand into the Midwest,” the statement read.“Nick was a beloved husband, son, brother, cousin and friend. Loved by all who knew him, Nick was known for his quick wit and zest for life, but most importantly, he was treasured and admired for his giving heart,” the statement reads. “Nick was always the first to offer help to anyone in need. From caring for ill family to helping friends move, he made time for those in his life.”Weaver was a “tremendous athlete” and grew up in central New York. His family said his proudest moment was captaining the New Hartford High School hockey team to a state championship. After that, he was a forward for the Siena College Hockey Club.Even after school Weaver played hockey and other sports. He organized softball teams and fantasy leagues for friends and family.Weaver’s family thanked everyone who has prayed for them and Nick, and asked for privacy while they grieve.“Nick was the heart of our family and friends,” the family wrote. “The family of Nick Weaver would like to thank the South Florida and upstate New York communities for their outpouring of sympathy during this difficult time.”

Kazakhstan suspends tourist flights to Egypt after Russian plane crash

ASTANA/ALMATY Kazakhstan has suspended tourist flights to Egypt due to safety concerns after a Russian passenger plane crashed there killing all 224 people onboard, Kazakh tourist companies and an airline said on Friday.Tez Tour Kazakhstan, one of Kazakhstan's leading tourist companies, said in a statement to its clients that tourist flights to Egypt had been stopped on Nov. 12 by an order from the Central Asian nation's Civil Aviation Committee.Kazakh airline Scat, the only Kazakh carrier offering charter flights to Egypt's Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, said the next flight on Nov. 17 would be made only to evacuate the travelers whom it brought there on Nov. 7. "We have received a request from our tourist firms to stop flights there because of a decline in demand for this route," Scat spokeswoman Viktoria Ulyanova told Reuters by telephone."We also received a recommendation from the Civil Aviation Committee to suspend flights," she said.
Tez Tour sent its clients a copy of the telegram it had received from the aviation authority, which said it had conducted a safety assessment, finding "a high level of threat to aviation security for Kazakhstan's airlines flying to Egypt"."One of the main possible versions of the (Russian plane's) crash was a terrorist act," it said.The committee said it "strongly recommends" that Kazakh air companies should not make flights to Egypt before the first results of the probe into the Russian air disaster have been published.
The Russian plane carrying tourists, which belonged to air company Kogalymavia, had been heading from Sharm el-Sheikh to the Russian city of St Petersburg when it crashed on Oct. 31, killing all 224 people on board.A number of countries have suspended flights to Egypt citing safety concerns after the crash.
Egypt was a favorite holiday destination for many Kazakhstanis, as it was for Russians.Kazakhstan's tourist industry, hit hard by the sharp devaluation of the national tenge currency in the past year, is now certain to suffer new losses, said Rashida Shaikenova, director of the Kazakhstan Tourist Association."Many tourists have already sold back their holiday vouchers for Egypt," she told Reuters. "We've already seen a 60-70 percent drop in demand for tourist trips abroad... The latest plane crash can make things even worse."

AKRON, Ohio - Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board continue to dig through a small mountain of debris at the crash site, even using small machinery, as they search for parts of the plane that could hold crucial clues into the crash. "There are still items we are looking through on site to attempt to find. So that's what we'll be doing over the next day or two," NTSB vice chairman Bella Dihn-Zarr said.  Akron Plane Crash FULL COVERAGEThe team of experts are keying in on certain clues, including what the NTSB calls witness marks. That's where the plane's left wing first made contact the ground. 

 "The tail was damaged, the wings were damaged and separated from the fuselage. But, all of it was at the accident site,"  said Jim Silliman, NTSB lead investigator.On Thursday afternoon, the plane was removed from the crash site. It was covered in a blue tarp and hauled off on a flatbed.The cockpit voice recorder, or CVR, is already at NTSB headquarters in Washington, D.C. "There's 30-minutes of conversation on the CVR. That's what we'll be looking at more carefully next week.  There was a conversation about the weather, about landing, "  Dihn-Zarr said.The NTSB won't speculate on a cause of the crash, neither will Tim Lanigan. Lanigan is a certified flight instructor and has flown into Akron-Fulton Airport dozens of times. He programmed into his flight simulator the almost identical conditions the pilots flew on Tuesday.Like so many people, Lanigan wonders what happened in those final seconds. "They both may've been outside looking for the airport and missed they were sinking below minimums, " Lanigan said.The pilots were experienced.  They had more than 10-thousand hours of flight time between them.--- Follow Chris Flanagan on Facebook and TwitterFollow @ChrisFlanaganTV Download the newsnet5 app:

South Florida victims of Akron plane crash to be remembered at services today in Palm Beach CountyPrivacy Policy





The Summit County Medical Examiner's Office in Ohio on Friday confirmed the identities of seven Palm Beach County residents who were killed in Tuesday's plane crash.The identified victims were Thomas Jay Virgin, 31, of Boca Raton; Diana Suriel, 32, of Wellington; Gary Shapiro, 35, of Boca Raton; Jared Weiner, 35, of Boca Raton; Ori Rom, 32, of Delray Beach; Nick Weaver, 34, of Boca Raton; and Diane Smoot, 50, of Delray Beach.
The seven worked for the close-knit real estate firm, Pebb Enterprises, based at 7900 Glades Road just outside Boca Raton.Though the medical examiner did not identify the two members of the ill-fated jet's crew, a Pompano Beach restaurant manager says his ex-brother-in-law died in the crash.


"He was one of the pilots in the crash," Marco Spina said.Airman Renato Marchese, 50, of Boynton Beach, was married to Raquel Cordoves. The couple have a 6-year-old son, Spina said.           "She Was Living Her Dream" Says Husband Of Wife Killed In Ohio Plane Crash CLICK To Watch Donna Rapado's Report CLICK To Watch Donna Rapado's ReportSee more videos   Spina said he, from Naples, and Marchese, from Rome, were two Italians who met at a Home Depot in the U.S. in July 2000. The men became married to sisters, until Spina and his wife divorced. But the men remained close, and Spina said his former spouse called him with the dreadful news."My ex-wife called right away," Spina said. "The owner of the private jet went to Renato and Raquel's house and said Renato was not coming back home, that the plane went down. It was very bad news."

As the families of nine South Floridians killed in a fiery Ohio plane crash struggled to cope with their losses, federal investigators offered hope Thursday that a 30-minute cockpit voice recording recovered from the wreckage could lead them to pinpoint a cause of the crash.Although the recording... (Mike Clary and Ken Kaye) Raquel Cordoves could not be reached Friday.Augusto Daniel Lewowicz, owner of Execuflight in Fort Lauderdale which operated the twin-engine Hawker 125-700, said Friday he could not comment."I saw him at all the holidays," Spina said. "He had lunch here [Café La Buca] right before he left on Saturday."Spina said his friend liked his Tiramisu."I knew him for a long, long time," Spina said. "It was very bad to lose him. He was a very good man, a person you can count on."Meanwhile Friday, hundreds turned out for a memorial service honoring Virgin. It was held at Saint Joan of Arc Catholic Church in Boca Raton. At 5 p.m. Friday, a service for Diana Suriel will take place at Palms West Funeral Home in Royal Palm Beach.Though some families were holding funeral services, Investigator Gary Guenther, with the medical examiner's office, said all nine bodies still were at the Akron facility. "If families have made arrangements, I expect there will be bodies released today," Guenther said.Virgin, the company's director of construction, was a CrossFit enthusiast known as T. Jay and the father of a daughter born in July. He had been a member of the Sigma Nu Fraternity, according to a donations webpage created on his behalf.His wife, Andrea Virgin, 31, on Wednesday posted a wedding photo of her and her smiling husband on Facebook, as well as a black-and-white picture depicting the laughing couple in formal attire. She included the caption: "I miss you. What I would give to have you back."Her Facebook page overflowed with condolences, promises to pray for her and her 4-month-old daughter, Victoria, and remembrances of "an amazing guy … a good friend, and a great father" with an "infectious personality."A project manager assistant, Suriel had a degree in architecture from Florida Atlantic University and joined the company in June, according to her LinkedIn profile.Suriel was the mother of a young daughter, according to her uncle Roberto Suriel. A native of New York, Suriel lived in the Dominican Republic for several years as a child, he said."She was very loving, always looking out for her family," said Roberto Suriel, 49.Staff writer Mike Clary contributed to this report.emiller@tribune.com, 561-243-6531 or Twitter @EmilyBethMiller

Landing an RC Plane on an RC Aircraft Carrier Is Mighty Impressive

Building your own 13-foot long remote control replica of the U.S.S. Kitty Hawk is challenging enough. But what good’s an aircraft carrier without any aircraft? So to further up the challenge, its creators also found a way to land an RC plane on it.

After almost two years of testing it became apparent that safely landing a traditional RC plane, in this case a ParkZone Ultra Micro T-28, on the carrier’s flight deck just wasn’t going to happen without an impossible amount of luck. So instead, a slow flying F-22 quadcopter was called in to duty. Landing it on the tiny carrier still requires a steady hand at the controls, but now that the tiny Kitty Hawk has proper air support, it can finally sail into battle. [YouTube]

AKRON, Ohio — The plane crash that killed nine people on Tuesday is the city's first deadly plane crash since 2000 and the seventh in the last 28 years.
Tuesday's crash is believed to be the deadliest in Akron's history. Six of those seven crashes involve Akron Fulton International Airport. 
Two pilots and seven employees of Florida-based real estate company Pebb Enterprises died after their private jet crashed into an apartment building in the 3000 block Mogadore Road as it approached Akron Fulton International Airport.

The death toll is more than the previous six crashes combined. Eight people died in crashes in Akron since 1986, according to records from the National Transportation Safety Board.
The 2000 crash happened shortly after takeoff from Akron Fulton. 
Rudolph Perry, 49, crashed his single-engine Beech A-23 into two houses about a half-mile from the runway. He died instantly. The crash destroyed one home and damaged another, causing about $230,000 worth of damage, according to a story published by the Plain Dealer Publishing Co.
Perry was told by airport mechanics to keep the plane grounded until they could figure out why the plane's engines were unable to generate enough power for a flight, according to NTSB records. No one on the ground was injured.
Five other crashes ended in death since 1986. Here is a synopsis of those crashes from NTSB records:
Sept. 10, 1995: A helicopter crashed at Akron Fulton shortly after liftoff. Gerald Nye, 61, of Ellwood City, Pennsylvania, had not flown in more than four years and was recommended by flight instructors to get more training before flying again. The NTSB ruled that pilot error caused the crash.
July 9, 1995: David Koval, 49, of Stow, died in the crash in his home-built Quickie II airplane during touch-and-go takeoffs and landings at Akron Fulton. The plane nose-dived as he went to land and crashed. NTSB investigators found Koval's lack of flying experience was the main contributor to the crash.
Sept. 29, 1993: The pilot of a Piper PA-24-250 and two passengers died on a flight from Austin, Minnesota en route to a car show in Hershey, Pennsylvania. The plane's wing was ripped off during the flight and debris scattered across a one-and-a-half-mile radius in Akron. NTSB investigators found no prior defect with the plane. The pilot lost control of the plane because he flew about 4,000 feet above what he should have been flying with no supplemental oxygen. Weather then ripped off a large part of the left wing.
Sept. 21, 1991: A pilot died after his plane ran out of fuel during touch-and-go takeoffs and landings at Akron Fulton. The plane nose-dived into the ground after more than an hour of flying. The pilot also had little experience flying, according to the NTSB.
May 31, 1986: A 61-year-old Brecksville pilot died after suffering a heart attack shortly after takeoff from Akron Fulton. His plane rose to about 500 feet before spiraling downward and crashing into a building.

Russia plane crash: Moscow bans Egypt Air flights after jet crash

                    Egypt is a hugely popular destination for Russian tourists
                

Russia's state aviation authority has banned Egypt's national carrier from flying to Russia, a Moscow airport spokesman says. Flights from Russia to Egypt are already suspended after a passenger plane crashed in the Sinai last month.All 224 people on board were killed, mostly Russian nationals. Egypt Air had been the only airline flying between the two countries and the move was to ensure it met safety requirements, Russian media reported.Sinai Province, a group affiliated to Islamic State, has repeatedly claimed it brought down Metrojet Flight 9268, flying from the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh to the Russian city of St Petersburg.




Western officials say there is a strong possibility that a bomb exploded on the plane, but Russia and Egypt say it is too early to draw conclusions.Following the crash, several countries, including the UK, halted flights to and from the resort due to intelligence concerns - stranding thousands of holidaymakers.Russia's action, effective from Saturday, is a further blow to Egypt's tourism industry. Russians make up close to one in three of all foreign tourists in Egypt. In 2014, about three million Russian nationals stayed at Egypt's resorts.

In case you ever need to travel halfway around the globe to tell Alec Guinness that he's your only hope to overthrow the massive Galactic Empire, Japan's All Nippon Airways has just the plane for you. Mashable took a trip inside the airline's new R2-D2-style Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which maintains all the styling consistency of your average Star Wars obsessive's basement with its plush Yoda dolls and Stormtrooper candy holders. Oh, and there are also lightsaber-wielding flight attendants — no word on whether they deliver in-flight announcements through a series of beeps, whirs, and clicks.All Nippon Airways also has a website set up to promote its Star Wars jet collaboration with Disney and Lucasfilm, in which it reveals that it will also have a BB-8-themed jet and a more generic Star Wars–themed jet flying American and Japanese routes. The site also lists the flight paths for the R2-D2 jet, which travels between San Jose and Narita in the coming months. Restructure your commute accordingly.

                    ﻿Jared Weiner was a natural.After graduating from law school and working few years in that profession, Weiner joined PEBB Enterprises to try his hand at the company development business.Weiner was among the nine victims of Tuesday’s plane crash in Akron, Ohio. Seven were employees of PEBB Enterprises, a Boca Raton real estate investment company.For complete coverage of the Akron, Ohio plane crash, click here.The intelligent, driven man took to the development industry immediately, quickly rising in the company and making his mark on the industry, said Bob Basehart, Wellington’s Planning and Zoning and Building Director who used to work as a private consultant for PEBB.Basehart, who met Weiner more than 10 years ago, said he was immediately struck by how the young man carried himself.“The one thing I would say about him is he was the type of person that when you met him, you would remember that you had met him,” he said.Anyone that knew the Weiners or had business dealings with them, could tell that they are a close-knit, Basehart said. The family is always there for each other and they worked well together.“They all loved each other and loved what they were doing and they really are a formidable team,” Basehart said.Though Basehart mostly worked with them on a professional level, he considered Jared a friend.“I think the world is not going to be quite as good a place without him,” he said.The National Transportation Safety Board remained at the scene of the wreckage Friday to continue its investigation.Templ B’Nai Torah confirmed in an e-mail to members that Jared Weiner and Ori Rom were among the seven local PEBB Enterprises employees killed in the crash.The e-mail reads:Dear Friends,It is with the deepest sadness that we inform you of the deaths of our beloved Jared Weiner and Ori Rom. They died in a plane crash on Tuesday along with five co-workers and two pilots.Jared, a former member of our board of directors, is the husband of Amanda, father of Jonah and Zoe, and the son of Carla and Bruce Weiner. Ori is the husband of Laurel, the son of Dalia and Henry Rom, and son-in-law of Carla and Bruce. The family’s pain is immeasurable.The funeral for Jared and for Ori will take place after their bodies are returned to Boca Raton. Funeral and shiva details will be shared as soon as they are available.The outpouring of concern, love and condolence has been overwhelming. The family knows that so many of you are thinking about them, that you share in their grief, and that as a community we will do whatever we can to alleviate even a small amount of their suffering.We are concerned for all of Jared and Ori’s friends who are experiencing this trauma in their own way. A group session with trained grief counselors and our rabbis will be scheduled for early next week.All expressions of sympathy should be expressed in notes and letters to the care of Bruce and Carla Weiner at 7099 Ayrshire Lane, Boca Raton, FL 33496-1419. Contributions in Jared and Ori’s memory are best directed to support the families of the other victims of this tragedy.

The incident was reported just after 9 a.m. on Dog Creek Road off Highway 221 near Ashe County Airport. Two people were on board the plane at the time of the incident.The single-engine plane tried to make an emergency landing at the airport after losing power, troopers said. However, due to crosswinds, the plane ended up making an emergency landing in a field, coming straight down with the aid of a parachute, troopers said.The field is about 1/8 mile from the end of the airport runway, FAA officials said.FAA records indicate the Cirrus SR22 is registered to a company out of Atlanta. The plane took off from DeKalb-Peachtree Airport in Atlanta and was heading to an airport in Lancaster, Pa., FAA officials said.
Winds Blowing very hard, carried plane down the field. @wxii pic.twitter.com/9bximTrpKy— William Bottomley (@wxiiwillieb) November 13, 2015About two hours after the emergency landing, a wind gust of up to 50 mph caught the parachute, which flipped the plane over and dragged it to a nearby creek. Fuel from the plane then started leaking into the creek.

Russia Plane Crash Update: Egypt Sending Metrojet Flight 9268 Black Box Abroad For Sound Analysis

            Russian charter airplane Ural airlines arrives at the airport of the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, Nov. 12, 2015. British and Russian planes arrive empty at Sharm al-Sheikh daily to bring back tourists after both countries suspended flights into the Red Sea resort.           

            Reuters/Asmaa Waguih          





As investigators continue to try and determine what caused the crash of Russian Metrojet flight 9268, Egypt’s civil aviation minister said a recording that features a sound before the plane broke up in the air would be sent abroad to be analyzed, AFP reported Friday. The minister did not specify which country would receive a copy of the black box recording.
“This sound will be analyzed with specific equipment that is not available in most countries," Civil Aviation Minister Hossam Kamal said, according to a state newspaper. “The last seven minutes of the black box recording will be sent to one of the countries that manufactures airplanes and that has this equipment to analyze this sound and its cause. The original recording will not be transported.”
The U.S. and the U.K. have both said the plane likely was downed by a bomb planted by a terrorist group. The aircraft was scheduled to fly from the Egyptian resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh to St. Petersburg, Russia, Oct. 31. Both Russia and the U.K. have restricted flights to Sharm el-Sheikh. The crash killed all 224 people aboard.
Approximately 3 million Russian tourists vacationed in Egypt in 2014 and the flight restrictions have hit Egypt’s tourism industry,  with the country potentially losing around $280 million a month. Russia’s tourism industry has lost approximately $23 million in less than a week since flights were suspended.
Russia and the U.K. have been sending empty flights to Egypt to return stranded tourists home. Egypt has been critical of the Western response of labeling the downing a terrorist act before the investigation has been completed.
"Some countries and Western media have created this strange atmosphere ... in that we were surprised by this quick and fierce media campaign pointing to a terrorist act without proof," Kamal said.
An affiliate of the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS, took responsibility for the crash but has not provided a detailed account. Russia began airstrikes in Syria Sept. 30 prompting ISIS to say it would retaliate against the Kremlin. ISIS issued a video Thursday threatening attacks against Russia.

It slammed into an apartment building, causing an "instant boom and flames and smoke.""It was horrific," Porter told CNN affiliate WOIO. "It was terrible."There was no one inside the four-unit apartment building when the small Hawker 700 plane smashed into it Tuesday, the Ohio State Highway Patrol said. That means no deaths or injuries on the ground, despite the jarring crash and massive fire that followed.Nine people -- seven passengers and two crew members -- died in the crash, said Bella Dinh-Zarr, vice chairwoman with the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the crash.This includes the pilot and co-pilot on the jet operated by ExecuFlight, a Florida company, plus "two principals and five employees" of Florida-based real estate company Pebb Enterprises.Read More"We are shocked and deeply saddened for the families, colleagues and friends of those who perished," Pebb Enterprises said on its website. "Our first priority is to give our fullest support to the family members and loved ones of our co-workers."Jeannie Ferrera said her younger sister was one of those Pebb Enterprises employees. She told CNN affiliate WEWS that she learned the news from her nephew, who got a call from Pebb on Tuesday night."I'm just in shock and in disbelief," Ferrera said. "And we just want to know what happened. ... We want some answers."ExecuFlight President, Augusto "Danny" Lewkowicz was similarly "perplexed" and crestfallen about the loss of the two crew members, who'd been flying together at his company for about a year."You can't really prepare for this kind of stuff," he said. "This is the lottery ticket that nobody wants."Big boom, followed by a sound like fireworksHaving set off from Dayton, the Hawker twin-engine, 10-passenger plane was approaching Akron Fulton International Airport when it crashed roughly two miles from the runway.  JUST WATCHEDSurveillance video shows Ohio plane crashReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSurveillance video shows Ohio plane crash 01:09The NTSB has security camera footage that shows the seconds leading up to the crash, Dinh-Zarr said.It shows the jet was flying very low, descending and banked to the left.  The left wing hit the ground, leaving a mark as the plane smashed into the apartments.A man who worked in an office about a block away from the accident told WOIO he heard the crash but didn't see it.Scott Ferrell said he could tell something had gone horribly wrong when he heard a plane engine cut out, fire up again, then cut out again."And probably a second later, I heard the explosion," Ferrell told the station. "(Then) there were power lives down everywhere. It was pretty chaotic (and) surreal."The plane clipped power lines before it went through the apartment building. Video of the aftermath showed a huge fireball engulfing the building -- and touching nearby power lines and possibly structures on either side -- as black smoke billowed above."There were a lot of popping noises, like a lot of fireworks were going off," Seth Yergin, who captured the fiery scene on video, said to WEWS.The smoke cleared to reveal the bulk of the plane in an embankment behind the building."The fuselage, the passenger compartment, is somewhat intact," Haymaker said. "... It is heavily burned, and that's (where) lies the problem."Dinh-Zarr said the pilot was using instruments to land and didn't make a distress call. CNN affiliate WJW of Cleveland reported that there was rain and low clouds in the area.NTSB investigators have interviewed a pilot who landed just ahead of the flight and might speak with him again about the conditions on approach.The cockpit voice recorder from the crash was sent to an NTSB lab in Washington. Apartment tenant: 'I lost everything'While experts from the Federal Aviation Administration and NTSB investigate what brought the plane down, firefighters were on site starting the recovery process, Akron fire Lt. Sierjie Lash said.Lewkowicz, from ExecuFlight, said that the aircraft was in good condition and well-maintained, and that both crew members were experienced."We don't know what happened," he said. "But we know that we will know what happened soon. ... Planes generally don't fall out of the sky."Dr. Lisa Kohler, the Summit County medical examiner, told reporters that her office will use its "mass fatality plan," given the scope of the tragedy. She said victims' names won't be released until each person is identified and their families are notified."This is a very complex situation," she said. "And it needs to be done very carefully, and it needs to be documented as well."Haymaker, from the State Highway Patrol, said late Tuesday that a top priority is getting the right information out to the loved ones of those on the plane.Then there is the struggle for those in Akron whose lives have been turned upside down by the crash. They include those who lived in the building hit directly, as well as the occupants of eight apartment units in the two buildings on either side.The Red Cross has stepped up to offer food, clothing, hotel rooms and other assistance to those affected, such as Beth Montgomery, whose home is now just a shell."I was just in shock, and I was crying and upset," she told WEWS of her feelings when she learned about the crash.

 Federal investigators are reviewing 30 minutes of cockpit audio recorded just before the fatal crash of a small business jet into an Ohio apartment building this week. 
 All nine people on board, including seven employees of a Florida real estate firm, died in the crash Tuesday afternoon in Akron. 
 The Hawker 125 7A twin-engine jet was making an initial approach to Akron Fulton Airport when it clipped power lines, veered left and plunged into the four-unit apartment structure Tuesday afternoon.

 Bella Dinh-Zarr, vice chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, told reporters Thursday that the plane's cockpit recorder was damaged in the crash — but the tape inside it wasn't. She said investigators recovered 30 minutes of "poor quality" audio, including "the sounds of impact." 
 But she refused repeated requests to say whether the tape recorded whether the pilot and the co-pilot — both of whom had thousands of hours of flight experience and the Federal Aviation Administration's highest certification — could be heard talking about the impending crash. 
 "The quality is quite poor," she repeated.

 Dinh-Zarr did, however, talk at length about radio traffic between the plane and the larger Cleveland air traffic control system before the pilots switched to the channel for the Akron airport.

 She said the plane was on the correct flight path, and she indicated that nothing unusual was discussed before the switch over — just weather conditions and the approach pattern. 
 The investigation is still early, Dinh-Zarr stressed in explaining why she wasn't giving much information. Both of the plane's turbine engines have been recovered and are being examined, and investigators are checking for any modifications, she said.

An Ohio medical examiner has identified the seven passengers flying on a small jet that crashed into an Akron apartment house earlier this week, killing all nine people on board.

The passengers were on a scouting trip for Pebb Enterprises, a real estate development company based in Boca Raton, Florida.

The crash killed two company principals, 35-year-old Jared Weiner of Boca Raton and 32-year-old Ori Rom of Delray Beach, Florida, and five employees: 34-year-old Nick Weaver of Boca Raton, 50-year-old Diane Smoot of Delray Beach, 32-year-old Diana Suriel of Wellington, Florida, 35-year-old Gary Shapiro of Boca Raton, and 31-year-old Thomas Virgin of Boca Raton.

The two pilots haven't been officially identified. The National Transportation Safety Board is combing through the wreckage for clues about what caused the crash.

Egypt
Egypt decides to have voice recording of crashed plane analyzed abroad

The final seven seconds of the cockpit voice recording from Metrojet flight 9268 will be sent abroad for analysis. Russia and Kazakhstan have meanwhile imposed further restrictions on Egyptian airliners.









Egypt's civil aviation minister, Hossam Kamal, said that 
a last-second noise
from the black box recording on Russian plane that had crashed on October 31 in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula would need to be sent abroad for further examination. He did not identify the country to which the recording would be sent.

Kamal told the Egyptian state-run newspaper "Al-Ahram" in an interview that a copy of the recording needed to be analyzed using foreign technology available only in countries in which Airbus planes were manufactured. The Airbus A321 in question was assembled in Germany using parts from the United States.

"This sound will be analyzed with specific equipment that is not available in most countries," Kamal told al-Ahram.

Kamal also stressed that the original tape would not be transported out of Egypt, which has been leading the investigation alongside representatives from other nations, including Russia, France, Germany and Ireland. Several governments - including Britain and Israel - have said that they believed the plane was likely downed by a bomb on board after it took off.

Further flight bans

The incident prompted Russia and some other countries to impose severe restrictions on flights to and from Egypt, which have dealt a severe blow to Egypt's tourism industry. In addition to the previous restrictions, the Russian aviation agency Rosaviatsia also banned all flights by Egypt Air going to Russia. The ban against Egypt's state-owned flag carrier will be effective as of November 14.

Kazakhstan followed suit and announced a suspension to all tourist flights to Egypt. The former Soviet Republic's Civil Aviation Committee stopped all flights to Egypt with immediate effect, with the sole exception being one flight intended to evacuate Kazakh tourists stuck in Egypt. The ban is to remain effective at least until the ultimate cause of the Metrojet crash is determined.

Britain also announced that it would stop 
repatriating holidaymakers
from Egypt early next week, adding that anyone who stayed behind would have to fly back "at their own risk." An estimated 20,000 British tourists were holidaying in Egypt when the Russian jet crashed. The announcement came as news emerged saying that British and American intelligence agencies had warned airlines seven weeks before the crash that an attack over Egyptian airspace could be imminent.

An affiliate of the self-styled "Islamic State" group
claimed that it had destroyed the plane, without providing details. The flight was heading from the popular Sinai resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh to the Russian city of St. Petersburg, when it crashed. All 224 people on the plane, most of whom were Russian nationals, were killed.

Cobalt Valkyrie: A Super Sleek Personal Aircraft

Cobalt is a private aircraft manufacturer launching its first two models today. The fully-certified Co50 Valkyrie and its experimental version, the Valkyrie-X, are available for pre-order starting today.
Valkyrie is super sleek and built for speed. It’s the fastest in its class (single piston engines), with the ability to travel up to 260 knots, as opposed to the typical 242 knots. It’s also safer than most private planes, according to Cobalt.
The craft is canard style, equipped with a forewing to prevent the plane from stalling mid-air, and comes with a five-seater, single-piston engine on the backend for smoother, safer take-offs and landings.

Classic fighter jets inspired the design with “clean lines and premium finishes” and Valkyrie comes in a range of custom hues, including darker colors like the deep black shown above.
The interior of the craft sports premium leather seating, hand-stitched by a former Hermes craftsman and a simple on/off switch dashboard design, complete with a place for your iPad. There’s also ample storage for typical rich-person-with-a-private-jet activities (golf bags, skis, suitcases with gold bars in them).



You’ll also notice the large plexiglass topper. Valkyrie offers an impressive 320-degree view with what Cobalt tells TechCrunch is the largest one-piece canopy in the world.

Additional specifications include:


Turbocharged 350HP, retractable, IFR-capable


Oxygenized non-pressurized


Cruise range: 1050 nautical miles (nmi) with NBAA IFR reserves


Customization: Interior and exterior are fully customizable upon request


Exact dimensions: 30 feet long x 30 feet wide x 10 feet high


The main difference between the Co50 and X, besides Co50’s certification, is the price. Valkyrie-X starts at $595,000, no money down, and with an estimated production period of six months, and Co50 Valkyrie will start at $699,000, with a $15,000 deposit. Cobalt tells us the Co50 will be ready by summer 2017.
TechCrunch was able to get an exclusive first look of the craft and chat with Cobalt CEO David Loury about it. Check out the video above to see it in action and learn more.

Fancy flying on one of these? New plane designs fit in over 600 passengers


Jen Mills for Metro.co.ukThursday 12 Nov 2015 5:20 pm 











(Picture: Emirates)
Think of Emirates planes and you might think of luxury, with sheikhs lying back in first class as flight attendants give them silver service.
But that won’t be happening on this plane at least – they have ripped out first class to cram even more economy seats into the cabin (better not tell Simon Danczuk).
(Picture: Emirates)
(Picture: Emirates)
The new jumbo jets will be able to fit in 615 passengers in business class and economy, which compares to a medium sized secondary school, all the inhabitants of a small village or almost 56 football teams.
Better start rehearsing your arguments for extra legroom now, then.
(Picture: Emirates)
(Picture: Emirates)
The new A380 airbus has 130 extra seats in economy taking up the spots where first class used to be, MailOnline reported, meaning there will be 98 passengers more than if first class was still included.
People won’t suddenly feel more cramped because the amount of space between seats will stay the same, and the in-flight screens will remain among the largest compared to rivals.
(Picture: Emirates)
The plane is the largest commercial jet in the world, with four engines and 13 rows made up of 10 seats, and the new design was unveiled this week at the Dubai Air Show.
Its first outing in the real world will be on the Dubai-Copenhagen route on 1 December, where a one-way ticket in cattle class costs around £350 for a seven -hour flight.
The company are confident this will prove profitable, as its economy class is already popular and took seventh place in this year’s Skytrax World Airline Awards.

(Photo: Emirates)There’s another first for the world’s biggest aircraft.Emirates unveiled a redesigned Airbus A380 over the weekend that boasts a record-breaking 615 passenger seats.The Airbus A380 is the world’s largest commercial passenger aircraft. (Emirates)The Airbus A380 is already the biggest commercial airliner in the world, with most carrier configurations accommodating around 520 passengers. Before Emirates debuted its new plane, Air France’s A 380s held the most passengers with 538 seats.Emirates’ new design eliminates bulky first class seats, instead offering just two classes– economy and business. By scrapping the first class and trimming 18 flat-bed seats from business class, the airline was able to add 130 economy seats, or 13 rows with 10 seats in each.The airline debuted two new reconfigured aircraft at the Dubai airshow this week.

Will the extra two be enough for 100 more people?At least when it comes to boarding, the planes double-decker design allows for passengers to board through both upper and lower entranceways but with so many more people, it will still take longer to get everyone inside.More from Fox News:Stunning video shows ‘jetmen’ flying in formation with Emirates A380Emirates defends 'snobbiest ad ever’ featuring Jennifer AnistonAirbus to Unveil 555-Passenger JetWATCH: Flying Singapore Airlines in First Class for an Hour Ruined My LifeLet Yahoo Travel inspire you every day.

What's This?

Emirates airlines has built a reputation for luxury. Now it's also set a record: for most seats in the largest passenger plane, the Airbus A380-800.
By doing away with first class, instead having just two classes on the new airliners — business and economy — Emirates has seats for 615 passengers. That's 98 more than the A380 can accommodate with a first class.

However, because Emirates removed first and business seats, there is no decrease in legroom for the economy seats.
The gigantic passenger plane will begin service between Dubai, UAE, and Copenhagen, Denmark, next month.

 New pictures show how Emirates scrapped first class on the world’s largest plane to accommodate the most passengers ever, with more than 550 economy seats.  The airline’s first two-class Airbus A380, launched this week at the Dubai Airshow, has gained 130 more economy seats than its sister three-class plane, by cutting out first class and reducing the number of business class flatbed seats. It now boasts 557 economy seats and 58 business, taking the total to an impressive 615 passenger seats. There is also a business class lounge.  Emirates’ existing A380s, both with three-classes, seat 489 and 517 passengers.  • Emirates' A380: first class review  The A380's economy class has 557 seats  Photo: Emirates The additional 130 seats have come in the shape of 13 rows of 10, however, customers will not have their legroom sacrificed.  The seats’ pitch, broadly translating as leg room, remains at up to 34 inches, the same as the Airbus A380’s three-class offering, however customers will lose out on a half-an-inch of seat width – down to 17.5 inches from 18.  • Six of the best first class cabins  Business class's lounge on the A380  Photo: Emirates The Dubai-based airline says each seat on the plane will feature one of the widest screens in the industry, at 13.3 inches. Its in-flight entertainment system offers access to more than 2,000 channels of films, tv shows, music and games.  • How I paid $300 for a round-the-world flight with Emirates  The two-class, double-decker A380 will begin commercial service on December 1, when it starts a route between Dubai and Copenhagen, a flight of about seven hours. An economy class return will cost around £570, with a business class ticket costing £2,985.  The aircraft's business class features flatbed seats  Photo: Emirates • The making of the Airbus A380: in pictures  The aircraft is Emirates’ 68th A380 in its fleet (with 72 more on order) and was flown direct to Dubai Airshow from Airbus's German headquarters in Hamburg, so the guests to view the plane at the event were the first in the world.  The plane on the tarmac at the Dubai Airshow  Photo: Getty Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman and Chief Executive, Emirates Airline & Group, said: “The Dubai Airshow has grown to become a key event in the aviation and aerospace calendar and it is fitting that the aircraft on display this year embody the growth of Emirates as a global airline and as an enabler focusing on meeting the future demand for highly skilled professional airline pilots.”  UK carrier British Airways took its Airbus A380s in the opposite direction, configuring each aircraft with four classes.

Plane crashes into Ohio apartment building

                                            A private plane crashed into an apartment building in Akron, Ohio Tuesday afternoon. Officials say no one was inside the building or an adjacent ...
                                    

The Tuesday afternoon crash in Akron - 2 miles from the small airport where the plane was to land - killed two executives and five employees at Pebb Enterprises, a Boca Raton-based company that specializes in shopping centers. The two pilots also were killed."Our hearts are broken this morning with the news of the tragic accident that took the lives of two principals and five employees of Pebb Enterprises," said a statement on the company website Wednesday. "We are shocked and deeply saddened for the families, colleagues and friends of those who perished."Officials haven't released names of the victims, but Jeannie Ferraia said that her sister, Diane Smoot, 50, was killed in the crash, CBS News correspondent Don Dahler reports."She was very excited because it was the first trip that she'd ever made with the executives," Ferraia said.Diane Smoot, second from left, is seen in a family photo provided by her sister, Jeannie Ferraia.

                                        The chartered plane left Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on Monday and stopped in St. Paul, Minnesota; Moline, Illinois; and St. Louis before arriving in Cincinnati, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware.The plane departed from Cincinnati on Tuesday morning and stopped in Dayton before crashing on its approach to Akron Fulton International just before 3 p.m.The 10-seat Hawker H25 business jet clipped utility wires and crashed into a four-unit apartment building, sparking a fire that destroyed the building, Ohio State Highway Patrol Lt. Bill Haymaker said. Nobody was home at any of the apartments, and there were no other injuries.The National Transportation Safety Board said that it has reviewed surveillance video that shows the plane seconds before it hit the building. The vice chairman from the NTSB said the video shows the plane flying at a low altitude and banking to left before it exploded into flames and a cloud of black smoke.Investigators have recovered the cockpit voice recorder from the crash and will review what's on it at a lab in Washington.A charred car and aircraft debris smolder where authorities say a small business jet crashed into an apartment building in Akron, Ohio, Nov. 10, 2015.

                                        A man who lived in the unit the plane crashed into said he wasn't home because he'd gone to the store to buy Hot Pockets, a brand of microwavable turnovers.Jason Bartley told the Akron Beacon Journal that he feels lucky but also in shock over the crash. The 38-year-old factory worker said he was coming home when he saw the flames.Investigators are trying to determine what caused the crash, which shook furniture in homes several blocks away and left behind fiery debris.It could take days to recover and identify the victims, Haymaker said."It's going to be extensive," he said.The Summit County coroner on Wednesday sought the expertise of a forensics team from Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pennsylvania, to help local officials at the site of the crash. The team specializes in crime scene and airplane crash recoveries of human remains.Crews work the scene after a small business jet crashed into an apartment building in Akron, Ohio, Nov. 10, 2015.

                                        Witnesses, including Carrie Willis, who lives several blocks away, said they heard explosions when the plane hit."I heard a big bang, and my couch shook twice," Willis said.Roberta Porter, who lives about a block from the site, said she was driving home when she saw the plane crash and burst into flames."This plane just dropped out of the sky, veered and crashed into the apartment building," Porter said.She said it's scary to think that if she had been driving faster the plane might have clipped her car.
